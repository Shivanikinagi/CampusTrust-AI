## Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions & Answers:

**Q: Why Algorand over other blockchains?**
A: "Algorand offers the perfect balance: it's fast (4.5s finality), cost-effective (low fees), environmentally friendly (carbon-negative), and has strong academic backing from MIT. For an educational application, these factors make it ideal."

**Q: What about data privacy?**
A: "We use zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive data. Personal information stays off-chain, while only verification hashes are stored on-chain. Students control what they share through their wallets."

**Q: How do existing systems integrate?**
A: "We provide REST APIs and webhooks for seamless integration. Our system can work alongside existing infrastructure or as a complete replacement."

**Q: What's the cost per transaction?**
A: "Algorand transactions cost approximately $0.001 each. For a campus of 10,000 students, monthly blockchain costs would be under $100."

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: "Our smart contracts are fully tested on TestNet. We're conducting security audits before MainNet deployment. The core technology is production-ready; we're refining the user experience."

**Q: What about institutions without blockchain knowledge?**
A: "That's exactly why we built this - to abstract complexity. Users interact through familiar web interfaces. They don't need to understand blockchain, just like they don't need to understand TCP/IP to use email."

**Q: Can credentials be revoked?**
A: "Yes. While issuance is permanent for audit trails, we maintain a revocation registry. Verifiers check both issuance and revocation status."

**Q: What happens if a student loses their private key?**
A: "We implement multi-signature recovery with institutional backup keys and guardian accounts. Students can recover access through verified identity processes."
