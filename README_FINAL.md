## 🎯 Overview

CampusTrust AI revolutionizes campus governance by combining **Algorand blockchain** immutability with **AI intelligence** to solve critical problems:

### 🔴 Problems We Solve

| Problem | Traditional Approach | Our Solution |
|---------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Election Fraud** | Paper ballots, manual counting, no audit trail | On-chain voting with one-student-one-vote enforcement |
| **Credential Forgery** | Paper certificates, manual verification | Blockchain-verified credentials with AI authenticity scoring |
| **Proxy Attendance** | Manual marking, easy to fake | AI anomaly detection with blockchain verification |
| **Event Permissions** | Paper approvals, lost in bureaucracy | Multi-signature smart contracts with status tracking |
| **Research Plagiarism** | Manual review, slow turnaround | AI-powered NLP peer review with plagiarism detection |
| **Compute Access** | Centralized labs, limited GPU access | P2P GPU/CPU marketplace with blockchain payments |
| **Treasury Misuse** | Opaque fund management | Multi-sig DAO with transparent on-chain governance |

### ✅ Our Impact

- ⚡ **3.3s Transaction Finality** (Algorand Pure PoS)
- 💰 **~$0.001 Per Transaction** (99% cheaper than Ethereum)
